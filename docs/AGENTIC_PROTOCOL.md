# Agentic execution protocol

Every task has one complete `prompt.md`. Tools and validation are available throughout the run. The following common workflow is already embedded in each prompt; do not send it as a second prompt.

## Agentic development workflow

Build the complete application in one end-to-end agentic run. You may use the filesystem, shell, dependency tools, compilers, linters, tests, documentation, browser automation, and debugging tools from the beginning, within the permissions and budget assigned by the harness. Plan, implement incrementally, execute, inspect, diagnose, and improve your work throughout development. No previous implementation is assumed. Do not stop at a proposal, scaffold, screenshot, or partially connected demo.

Use the installed browser automation skill `agent-browser` to validate your work. Read the installed skill and its version-matched core workflow before use; consult its exploratory-testing workflow when available. If this capability is genuinely unavailable, use another available real-browser automation tool, record the substitution, and state any coverage that remains blocked. Do not fabricate successful tool use or let a missing optional tool prevent useful work with the tools you do have. The evaluator records tool availability separately from implementation quality.

## Validation

Exercise the actual main workflow using browser navigation, labeled controls, pointer and keyboard input, and screenshots. Merely loading the page, inspecting source code, or observing a DOM element does not establish that a feature works. For Canvas, WebGL, audio, games, and other non-DOM state, perform real interactions and inspect both rendered output and relevant live diagnostics. Check the browser console, uncaught errors, failed requests, and meaningful application state.

Check normal desktop and narrow viewports (at least 1280 x 800 and 390 x 844), input continuity, primary controls, error states, navigation, and any required pause/reset, import/export, or persistence behavior. Reproduce observed failures, fix their cause, and repeat the failed flow plus a compact regression test after material changes. Run the task-specific checks below against genuine application behavior. Do not modify benchmark requirements, supplied fixtures, expected results, or evaluator code to make a test pass.

Keep evidence in a sibling `evidence/` directory: an agent-authored `validation.md` with the exact steps and commands, observed results, failures, relevant screenshots/logs, fixes, and retest outcomes. Use pass, fail, blocked, or not-run honestly; a blocked check is not a pass. Do not write or invent an evaluator-owned score or report. End within the assigned budget with the best working implementation and an explicit account of remaining limitations.

### Standalone HTML delivery and runtime checks

Write the final application to `index.html` in the working directory. The delivered application must remain one self-contained file with the original runtime/dependency restrictions; development tools, test scripts, and a temporary local HTTP server for browser inspection are allowed and are not runtime dependencies of the delivered artifact. Keep evidence and test harnesses outside `index.html`.

Verify that opening the delivered file directly works as required, and that it does not fetch external assets or services. If your browser tool only supports local HTTP, also inspect the artifact's dependency assumptions, record the direct-file check as blocked rather than passed, and preserve direct-file compatibility. When checking via local HTTP, block external internet but leave that local server reachable; test without external cached resources. For audio, explicitly enable playback with a user gesture. Do not claim audio quality was heard when only meters or audio state were inspected.

### Real application delivery and runtime checks

Deliver the complete runnable project in `project/`, with `benchmark.json` and README at its root. Keep `evidence/` beside `project/`. Install the declared dependencies when permitted, generate genuine lockfiles with the actual package manager where applicable, build, start the application, and run meaningful automated tests. Do not substitute test doubles or precomputed UI outcomes for business logic.

Use a fresh run-specific `DATA_DIR` outside the source tree. Exercise browser flows against the real local backend. Supplement browser checks with actual HTTP requests, backend logs, and data inspection for concurrency, idempotency, permissions, and persistence. Use genuinely overlapping requests where specified. For independently authenticated users or devices, use separate top-level browser contexts with isolated storage. Reload after committed changes, then stop and restart the backend against the same `DATA_DIR` and verify durable state.

After dependency setup, verify operation with external internet blocked while local loopback access to the app and its declared companion service remains available. This does not mean turning off the app's own backend. Only a task explicitly requiring offline editing must also be tested disconnected from its local backend. Do not erase state to hide a persistence failure. Keep all supplied public scenario and fixture files read-only; changes to the generated application must preserve the specified behavior for other valid inputs too.
